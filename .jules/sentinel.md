## 2025-02-24 - [CSP Hardening and Inline Script Consolidation]
**Vulnerability:** The website's Content Security Policy (CSP) allowed `'unsafe-inline'` in `script-src`, leaving it vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Inline scripts for Analytics, Web Vitals, and Service Worker registration were scattered throughout `index.html`.
**Learning:** Moving non-critical inline scripts to a single external file (`assets/js/security-init.js`) enables a stricter CSP. However, critical scripts like Anti-clickjacking and CSS loading must remain inline for performance and security, requiring their SHA-256 hashes to be explicitly allowed in the CSP. Inline event handlers (like `onload`) also violate strict CSP and must be refactored into external scripts.
**Prevention:** Design new pages with strict CSP in mind. Avoid inline scripts and event handlers. Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) for all external scripts to prevent tampering.
