Alternative Service Worker Organization Script
===========================================

This script demonstrates how to organize service workers while maintaining proper scope.
Two approaches:

1. Keep SW in root with organized naming: sw-main.js, sw-cache.js, etc.
2. Use a proxy SW in root that imports the actual worker from assets/js/

This is for reference - not implementing automatically.
"""

# Approach 1: Organized naming in root
# - sw-main.js (main service worker)
# - sw-cache.js (caching strategies)
# - sw-sync.js (background sync)

# Approach 2: Proxy pattern
