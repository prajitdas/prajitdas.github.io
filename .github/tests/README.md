# Website Security and Functionality Tests

This directory contains automated tests to ensure the website remains secure and functional after security modifications.

## Test Files

### 1. `comprehensive_security_scan.py`

**Purpose**: Comprehensive security audit scanning for potentially sensitive files that shouldn't be publicly accessible.

**Features**:

- Tests 41+ potentially sensitive file types and paths
- Categorizes security risks (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Provides detailed reporting on accessible files
- Helps identify files that need protection

**Usage**:

```bash
python3 .github/tests/comprehensive_security_scan.py
```

### 2. `website_functionality_test.py`

**Purpose**: Comprehensive website functionality verification after security changes.

**Features**:

- Tests all critical website components (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
- Verifies essential functionality remains intact
- Checks that moved files are properly protected
- Provides detailed success/failure reporting
- Exit codes for CI/CD integration

**Usage**:

```bash
python3 .github/tests/website_functionality_test.py
```

**Exit Codes**:

- `0`: All critical components working (success)
- `1`: Minor issues but website functional (warning)
- `2`: Critical functionality impaired (error)

## Test Categories

### Critical Components (Must Work)

- Main website pages (index.html)
- Core JavaScript libraries (jQuery, Bootstrap, custom JS)
- Core CSS stylesheets (Bootstrap, main styles)
- Essential images (Profile image)
- Important documents (Resume PDF)

### Optional Components (Nice to Have)

- Font icons and additional styling
- SEO files (robots.txt, sitemap.xml)
- Error pages
- Google verification files

### Security Verification

- Confirms moved files are no longer accessible
- Validates protection mechanisms are working
- Ensures development files are secured

## Running All Tests

To run a complete security and functionality assessment:

```bash
# Security audit
python3 .github/tests/comprehensive_security_scan.py

# Functionality verification
python3 .github/tests/website_functionality_test.py
```

## CI/CD Integration

These tests can be integrated into GitHub Actions workflows:

```yaml
- name: Run Website Functionality Test
  run: python3 .github/tests/website_functionality_test.py

- name: Run Security Scan
  run: python3 .github/tests/comprehensive_security_scan.py
```

## Security Implementation Status

### ✅ Protected Files (Moved to .github/)

- Development documentation (README.md, SECURITY.md)
- Build scripts and development tools
- Internal documentation and help files
- Configuration templates

### ⚠️ Remaining Accessible Files

- `LICENSE` - Required to be publicly accessible for open source compliance
- Some build artifacts - May be required for GitHub Pages functionality

### 🔒 Protection Mechanisms

1. **File Relocation**: Sensitive files moved to `.github/` directory
2. **`.htaccess` Rules**: Server-level blocking (limited on GitHub Pages)
3. **`robots.txt`**: Search engine directives
4. **Jekyll Exclusions**: Build-time file exclusion

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Testing**: Run functionality tests after any security changes
2. **Monitor Accessibility**: Use security scans to identify new sensitive files
3. **Documentation**: Keep this README updated with new test files or changes
4. **CI Integration**: Consider adding these tests to automated workflows

## Test Results Interpretation

- **🎯 Critical Components**: Must be 100% for website to function
- **📋 Optional Components**: Should be >80% for optimal experience  
- **🔒 Security Verification**: Should be >80% for adequate protection
- **🏆 Overall Status**: Combines all metrics for final assessment
