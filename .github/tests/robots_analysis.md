# robots.txt Analysis Report

## üö® POTENTIAL SECURITY ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. **Information Disclosure**
The current robots.txt actually **reveals the existence** of sensitive files to crawlers and attackers:

```
Disallow: /README.md
Disallow: /SECURITY.md  
Disallow: /LICENSE
Disallow: /_config.yml
Disallow: /.gitattributes
Disallow: /.gitignore
Disallow: /.htaccess
Disallow: /.codacy.yml
Disallow: /.trivyignore
```

**Problem**: This tells attackers exactly which files exist and where to find them!

### 2. **Files Actually Moved**
Many of these files have already been moved to `.github/` directory:
- `SECURITY.md` ‚Üí moved to `.github/dev-docs/`
- Some config files already relocated

**Problem**: robots.txt is blocking files that no longer exist in these locations.

### 3. **Redundant with Directory Protection**
```
Disallow: /.github/
```
This is redundant because:
- `.github/` directory is already protected by GitHub Pages
- Files were moved there specifically for protection

### 4. **Missing Important Allows**
The robots.txt doesn't explicitly allow important website assets:
- CSS files needed for website styling
- JavaScript files needed for functionality
- Images needed for display
- The resume PDF we just added to tests

## üîç VERIFICATION TEST
Let me test if robots.txt is actually exposing information...
