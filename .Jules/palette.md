## 2024-05-23 - Accessibility: Skip to Content
**Learning:** Single-page sites with fixed headers often trap keyboard users in a navigation loop unless a "Skip to Content" link is provided. This is a critical WCAG 2.1 requirement (2.4.1 Bypass Blocks).
**Action:** Always include a visually hidden, focus-visible skip link as the first focusable element in the DOM for pages with repeated navigation headers.
