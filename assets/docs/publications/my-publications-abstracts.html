<blockquote><font size="-1">
System calls provide an interface to the services made available by an operating system. As a result, any functionality provided by a software application eventually reduces to a set of fixed system calls. Since system calls have been used in literature, to analyze program behavior we made an assumption that analyzing the patterns in calls made by a mobile application would provide us insight into its behavior. In this paper, we present our preliminary study conducted with 534 mobile applications and the system calls made by them. Due to a rising trend of mobile applications providing multiple functionalities, our study concluded, mapping system calls to functional behavior of a mobile application was not straightforward. We use Weka tool and manually annotated application behavior classes and system call features in our experiments to show that using such features achieves mediocre F1-measure at best, for app behavior classification. Thus leading to the conclusion that system calls were not sufficient features for app behavior classification.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Context-sensitive access control has been a research topic within mobile computing for more than a decade. Much of the work has focused on modeling context and representing policies. Choosing an appropriate policy for a user, however, remains a challenging goal. Creating usable mobile access control solutions have been researched from a users' permission control perspective. We present a study carried out with subjects using their personal mobile devices that captures individualized policies through an iterative user feedback process. Policy precision, also referred to as "Violation Metric" (VM), was used to decide when all necessary policies had been captured. The feedback process used a hierarchical context ontology to represent user-context and gathered contextual-situations in which a policy would be applicable. The study also investigated the feasibility of using the VM measure to determine completion of the capture process for the users' personalized access control policies, that handles their mobile privacy and security needs. Using an appropriate pre-defined policy is shown to have lesser user impact when trying to personalize access control policies for users.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
There are ongoing security and privacy concerns regarding mobile platforms that are being used by a growing number of citizens. Security and privacy models typically used by mobile platforms use one-time permission acquisition mechanisms. However, modifying access rights after initial authorization in mobile systems is often too tedious and complicated for users. User studies show that a typical user does not understand permissions requested by applications or are too eager to use the applications to care to understand the permission implications. For example, the Brightest Flashlight application was reported to have logged precise locations and unique user identifiers, which have nothing to do with a flashlight application's intended functionality, but more than 50 million users used a version of this application which would have forced them to allow this permission. Given the penetration of mobile devices into our lives, a fine-grained context-dependent security and privacy control approach needs to be created. We have created Mithril as an end-to-end mobile access control framework that allows us to capture access control needs for specific users, by observing violations of known policies. The framework studies mobile application executables to better inform users of the risks associated with using certain applications. The policy capture process involves an iterative user feedback process that captures policy modifications required to mediate observed violations. Precision of policy is used to determine convergence of the policy capture process. Policy rules in the system are written using Semantic Web technologies and the Platys ontology to define a hierarchical notion of context. Policy rule antecedents are comprised of context elements derived using the Platys ontology employing a query engine, an inference mechanism and mobile sensors. We performed a user study that proves the feasibility of using our violation driven policy capture process to gather user-specific policy modifications.We contribute to the static and dynamic study of mobile applications by defining "application behavior" as a possible way of understanding mobile applications and creating access control policies for them. Our user study also shows that unlike our behavior-based policy, a "deny by default" mechanism hampers usability of access control systems. We also show that inclusion of crowd-sourced policies leads to further reduction in user burden and need for engagement while capturing context-based access control policy. We enrich knowledge about mobile "application behavior" and expose this knowledge through the Mobipedia knowledge-base. We also extend context synthesis for semantic presence detection on mobile devices by combining Bluetooth, low energy beacons and Nearby Messaging services from Google.

As of 2016, there are more mobile devices than humans on earth. Today, mobile devices are a critical part of our lives and often hold sensitive corporate and personal data. As a result, they are a lucrative target for attackers, and managing data privacy and security on mobile devices has become a vital issue. Existing access control mechanisms in most devices are restrictive and inadequate. They do not take into account the context of a device and its user when making decisions. In many cases, the access granted to a subject should change based on context of a device. Such fine-grained, context-sensitive access control policies have to be personalized too. In this paper, we present the Mithril system, that uses policies represented in Semantic Web technologies and captured using user feedback, to handle access control on mobile devices. We present an iterative feedback process to capture user specific policy. We also present a policy violation metric that allows us to decide when the capture process is complete.

Contemporary smartphones are capable of generating and transmitting large amounts of data about their users. Recent advances in collaborative context modeling combined with a lack of adequate permission model for handling dynamic context sharing on mobile platforms have led to the emergence of a new class of mobile applications that can access and share embedded sensor and context data. Most of the time such data is used for providing tailored services to the user but it can lead to serious breaches of privacy. We use Semantic Web technologies to create a rich notion of context. We also discuss challenges for context aware mobile platforms and present approaches to manage data flow on these devices using semantically rich fine-grained context-based policies that allow users to define their privacy and security need using tools we provide.

The Internet of Things (IoT), also referred to as Cyber-Physical Systems, is a collection of physical entities with computational and communication capabilities. The storage and computing power of these devices is often limited and their designs currently focus on ensuring functionality and largely ignore other requirements, including security and privacy concerns. We present the design of a framework that allows IoT devices to capture, represent, reason with, and enforce information sharing policies. We use Semantic Web technologies to represent the policies, the information to be shared or protected, and the IoT device context.

The number of mobile applications (apps) in major app stores exceeded one million in 2013. While app stores provide a central point for storing app metadata, they often impose restrictions on the access to this information thus limiting the potential to develop tools to search, recommend, and analyze app information. A few projects have circumvented these limitations and managed to create a dataset with a substantial number of apps. However, accessing this information, especially for the purpose of an integrated view, is difficult as there is no common standard for publishing data. We present Mobipedia, an effort to gather this information from various sources and publish it as RDF Linked Data. We describe the status of Mobipedia, which currently has information on more than one million apps that has been extracted from a number of unstructured and semi-structured sources.

Capturing, maintaining, and using context information helps mobile applications provide better services and generates data useful in specifying information sharing policies. Obtaining the full benefit of context information requires a rich and expressive representation that is grounded in shared semantic models. We summarize some of our past work on representing and using context models and briefly describe Triveni, a system for cross-device context discovery and enrichment. Triveni represents context in RDF and OWL and reasons over context models to infer additional information and detect and resolve ambiguities and inconsistencies. A unique feature, its ability to create and manage "contextual groups" of users in an environment, enables their members to share context information using wireless ad-hoc networks. Thus, it enriches the information about a user's context by creating mobile ad hoc knowledge networks.

Wearable computing devices like Google Glass are at the forefront of technological evolution in smart devices. The ubiquitous and oblivious nature of photography using these devices has made people concerned about their privacy in private and public settings. The Face-Block (http://face-block.me/) project protects the privacy of people around Glass users by making pictures taken by the latter, Privacy-Aware. Through sharing of privacy policies, users can choose whether or not to be included in pictures. However, the current privacy model of FaceBlock only permits simple constraints such as allow versus disallow pictures.

Mobile devices can better manage user privacy if they continuously model a user's context, but doing so can result in high energy consumption. We describe an approach which will reduce energy costs by reasoning about what context information is known, what additional information is needed, how accurate it must be and how to efficiently acquire it. We model the sensors and their data properties, accuracy levels and energy costs in a knowledge base supported by an ontology. We describe a method to manage privacy on smartphones in an energy efficient manner by selecting the best choice sensor for maintaining the user's context information. Sensor selection is done by COntext MANager miDDleware (COMANDD), which maintains a context model and answers queries about it. Context requests are served by capability matching, accuracy level matching and selection of lowest energy cost sensor for reporting context data. A context change detection function is used to decide when the context should be updated.

We recognize this change as a potential threat to data privacy, both of the user and also of corporations whose data is on employee owned phones. We describe a method to carry out energy efficient privacy preservation on a mobile smart-phone. Our work is based on a study of an Android smartphone's component-wise energy consumption pattern and is based on a three-fold approach to ensure efficient execution of privacy policies, based on user and app context modeled using semantic web technologies.
