# Publications Directory

This directory contains publication-related documents and assets.

## Python Scripts

For security reasons, Python scripts have been moved to the `.config/` directory in the repository root:

- `genWordCloud.py` â†’ `.config/genWordCloud.py`

These scripts are used for generating publication-related content but should not be accessible via the web.

## Usage

To run the scripts:

```bash
cd /path/to/repository
python .config/genWordCloud.py
```
